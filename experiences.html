                    <p class="general-text">I've worked my entire carreer as a backend software engineer, most part of the time using C# which is the language I feel more confortable with, but I also have a solid knowledge in Python and Vb.Net. I'm experienced on relational databases and I have some experience with NoSQL and cache databases.</p>
                    <p class="general-text">My first long experience in a company was working for a chilean multinational building tax solutions to allow companies being in compliance with brazilian fiscal rules.</p>
                    <p class="general-text">Then back in 2015 I started to work for a software house which I left in 2022, and during that time I was involved in a huge sort of projects for companies of all sizes. In those projects I had the opportunity to create mobile apps, web and desktop applications, in some of them I worked as a dev team member, but in some projects I was responsible for gathering requirements, designing the architectural solution and the elaboration of the software developmet proposals, in others I was the tech lead, being responsible to keep the team working without impedments.</p>
                    <p class="general-text">In august of 2022 was hired to work at Wex Inc, an american tech company with more than 6k employees and operation all around the world, which is my first opportunity to work using English as the main language on a daily basis.</p>
